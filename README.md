# AdBer

AdBer is a portfolio project designed to showcase my skills in web development. It simulates email and messenger services, allowing users to text each other by email. More features are currently in development.

## Features

- **Messaging**: Users can send messages to each other using email addresses.
- **Sign-In Required**: Access is available after signing in.
- *More features are planned and will be added soon.*

## Installation

No installation is required as AdBer is a web-based application. Simply sign in on the website to start using it.

## Usage

As AdBer is hosted on the web, users can access it directly through their browser after signing in.

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome! If you have any suggestions or improvements, feel free to get in touch. I'll be adding more detailed guidelines in the future.
